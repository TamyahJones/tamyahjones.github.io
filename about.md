My name is Tamyah Jones, I am a sprinter (100m and 200m) and I'm 14.

I have an ever growing interest in law.

Really, I'm doing this blog for me and in the process I'll learn more about law and maybe learn more about myself.

 On this blog I will be writing about cases that I have seen and give my opinion on whether I agree with the outcome or not.
